# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications related to asynchronous data access. The `bug.js` file shows incorrect handling of asynchronous operations when retrieving data from the Firebase Realtime Database, leading to potential errors. The correct approach, demonstrated in `bugSolution.js`, ensures that data is accessed only after it has been successfully retrieved. 

## Problem

The problem lies in attempting to access data retrieved asynchronously before the asynchronous operation completes.  The example shows that accessing the data outside the promise's `then` block results in an undefined value.
